# Load Balancing Simulator

A modern web application for simulating and comparing load balancing algorithms in cloud computing environments. This simulator focuses on comparing the Round Robin (RR) and Enhanced Particle Swarm Optimization (EPSO) algorithms for task scheduling in cloud datacenters.

## About

The Load Balancing Simulator provides an interactive environment to:
- Simulate task scheduling using RR and EPSO algorithms
- Visualize resource allocation in real-time
- Compare performance metrics between algorithms
- Analyze scheduling logs and results
- Upload custom workload datasets
- Configure simulation parameters

## Features

- üîÑ Real-time animation of task scheduling
- üìä Detailed performance metrics and comparisons
- üìà Interactive charts and visualizations
- üìÅ Custom workload file upload support
- ‚öôÔ∏è Configurable simulation parameters
- üìù Comprehensive scheduling logs
- üíæ Results export functionality

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager
- Java 17 or higher (for backend)
- Modern web browser

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/thesis-system.git
```

2. Frontend setup:
```bash
cd thesis-frontend
npm install
```

3. Backend setup:
```bash
cd ../thesis-backend
mvn install
```

4. Start the backend server:
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

5. In a new terminal, start the frontend:
```bash
cd ../thesis-frontend
npm run dev
```

6. Access the application at `http://localhost:5173`

## Configuration

1. Frontend:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Update API endpoint if needed

2. Backend:
   - Configure `application.properties`
   - Set up database connection if required

## Verification

- Backend server should be running on port 8080
- Frontend dev server on port 5173
- No console errors in browser
- Successful API connection test

This frontend works with our Java-based backend simulation engine:

Backend Repository: https://github.com/kierre-yes/research_sim.git

Make sure to clone and run the backend server before using this frontend application.
Please read the README.md file in the root directory for further documentation.
